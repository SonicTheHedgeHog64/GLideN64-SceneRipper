## About

Modified version of GLideN64 that allows for scene ripping from N64 games.

Features 34 different rip modes, vertex color, fog information, and CSV export support.

Developed on RMG 0.2.5 and Blender 3.3.1. Included python script should work on 2.80+.

Continuous ripping support is planned to be added for animation ripping. Pull requests are welcome.
